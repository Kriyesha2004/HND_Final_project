CarePoint – A Safe Digital Space for Mental Health and Expression

CarePoint is a web-based mental health support platform designed for youth in Sri Lanka who struggle to express their thoughts and emotions openly. The system provides a private, supportive, and creative space where users can journal, track their mood, chat anonymously, listen to calming music, and optionally consult mental health professionals.

🌱 Our Vision

To create a safe digital environment that encourages emotional expression, self-reflection, and mental wellbeing.

🎯 Problem Addressed

Many individuals in Sri Lanka experience mental health challenges but are reluctant to seek help because of:

Social stigma

Lack of privacy

Fear of judgement

Limited access to professional support
CarePoint bridges this gap by offering anonymous and non-judgmental support tools.
